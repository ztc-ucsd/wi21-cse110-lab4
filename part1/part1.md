1. The length - 1 of prices will be printed 
2. The last price with the discount applied will be printed
3. Will print out the last discountedPrice calculated from prices
4. [50, 100, 150]   This is returned because discounted is an array an the loop will apply the discount rounding to 2 decimal places.
5. Will be an error because 'i' is not defined outside of the for loop
6. Error because discountedPrice isn't defined in the scope
7. Will print out the last discountedPrice calculated from prices
8. [50, 100, 150]   This is returned because discounted is an array an the loop will apply the discount rounding to 2 decimal places.
9. Will print the value of i
10. It will print the discounted price of the first price because it cannot be updated after the initial assignment
11. Will print 0 because it won't get updated
12. [0, 0, 0]      finalPrice will remain 0 but push will still work for a const array
13A. student.name
13B. student['Grad Year']
13C. student.greeting();
13D. student['Favorite Teacher'].name
13E. student.courseLoad[0];
14A. '32'   2 is converted to string and is concatenated 
14B. 1      3 is converted to an number
14C. 3      null converted to 0 and added to 3
14D. '3null'    null is converted to string and concatenated
14E. 4      true is 1
14F. 0      false is 0 and null is converted to 0
14G. '3undefined'   converted to string
14H. NaN    is undefined, can't subtract undefined from a string
15A. true   '2' converted to number 2
15B. false  the first character of the '2' comes after '1' so it is false
15C. true   '2' converted to number
15D. false  type mismatch
15E. false  true is converted to 1
15F. true   Boolean(2) is true and true==true and same thpe
16. === does not do type conversions while == does do type conversions.
17. 'How are you?' gets printed because the first if statement is false and moves on to the second one else if(2) which evaluates to true
19. [6, 8, 10]  the callback function is called adding 2 to the number then the result is returned and multiplied by 2
21. Output:
        1
        4
        3
        2
